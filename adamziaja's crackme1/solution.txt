Solution to crackme1 by adamziaja
=================================
(problem published 14. May 2014)

Start by running the program:

    $ ./crackme1
    username:
    Peter
    username must be between 8 and 12! 
    username:
    Big Head 
    serial number:
    1234
    WRONG!

Searching for string ``WRONG!`` leads to the following lines of disassembly: 
    00401380                 cvtsi2sd xmm0, eax
    00401384                 movsd   xmm1, [rbp+var_2F8]
    0040138C                 ucomisd xmm0, xmm1
    00401390                 jp      short loc_4013B6
    00401392                 ucomisd xmm0, xmm1
    00401396                 jnz     short loc_4013B6
    00401398                 mov     esi, offset aSNOk ; "s/n OK!"
    0040139D                 mov     edi, offset _ZSt4cout@@GLIBCXX_3_4
    004013A2                 call    __ZStlsISt11char_traitsIcEERSt13basic_ostreamIcT_ES5_PKc 
    004013A7                 mov     esi, offset __ZSt4endlIcSt11char_traitsIcEERSt13basic_ostreamIT_T0_ES6_ 
    004013AC                 mov     rdi, rax
    004013AF                 call    __ZNSolsEPFRSoS_E 
    004013B4                 jmp     short loc_4013D2
    004013B6 ; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    004013B6
    004013B6 loc_4013B6:                             ; CODE XREF: main+303j
    004013B6                                         ; main+309j
    004013B6                 mov     esi, offset aSNWrong ; "s/n WRONG!

In line 00401392 the SSE registers ``xmm0`` and ``xmm1`` are compared.
If they are not equal, then the next line (``jnz     short loc_4013B6``)
causes the program to jump to ``loc_4013B6`` which prints ``WRONG!``. If, on
the other hand, the two registers are equal, then the flow continues
on line 00401398 which prints ``OK!``. So we are looking for inputs that 
lead to ``xmm0 = xmm1`` in line 0x401396.

Next, we open the executable in a 64 debugger. I used GDB on a 64bit 
Linux host. First, set a breakpoint at line 0x401396:

    $ gdb ./crackme1 -silent
    Reading symbols from ./crackme1...done.
    (gdb) break *0x401396
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x401396: file main.cpp, line 42.

Now run the code and enter a username and serial. 

    (gdb) run
    Starting program: /home/phreak/privat/clones/crackmes/crackme1 
    username:
    01234567
    serial number:
    771

    Breakpoint 1, 0x0000000000401396 in main () at main.cpp:42
    42	main.cpp: No such file or directory.

The execution stops right at ``jnz   short loc_4013B6`` (before actually
executing the line). Let's print ``xmm0`` and ``xmm1``:

    (gdb) p $xmm0
    $1 = {v4_float = {5.62949953e+14, 16.8905296, 0, 3.57331108e-43}, 
        v2_double = {48495051, 5.4110892669614444e-312}, 
        v16_int8 = {0, 0, 0, 88, -50, 31, -121, 65, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0}, 
        v8_int16 = {0, 22528, 8142, 16775, 0, 0, 255, 0}, v4_int32 = {
            1476395008, 1099374542, 0, 255}, 
        v2_int64 = {4721777705421373440, 1095216660480}, 
        uint128 = 0x000000ff0000000041871fce58000000}
    (gdb) p $xmm1
    $2 = {v4_float = {0, 4.25292969, 0, 0}, 
        v2_double = {771, 0}, 
        v16_int8 = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 24, -120, 64, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, 
        v8_int16 = {0, 0, 6144, 16520, 0, 0, 0, 0}, 
        v4_int32 = {0, 1082660864, 0, 0}, 
        v2_int64 = {4649993003539103744, 0}, 
        uint128 = 4649993003539103744}

The instruction to compare the two SSE registers is ``ucomisd``, which 
compares the *low double-precision floating-point values*, i.e., the first
value in ``v2_double`` in the above output:
    
    xmm0 = 48495051
    xmm1 = 771

We see that the serial was copied to xmm1, while xmm0 is probably based
on the username. We see that ``xmm0`` contains the number 48, 49, 50, 51. 
Those are the ASCII codes for the characters ``0``, ``1``, ``2``, and ``3``
respectively. So the we can formulate the following first assumption
for the validation algorithm:

Version 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Concatenate the ASCII codes of the letters of the username and take
the first 8 bytes of the result:

    def keygen_version1(username):
        key = '' 
        for u in username:
            key += str(ord(u))
        return key[:8]
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's run the code again within gdb and enter a different username. 
Note that the value of ``xmm0`` comes from ``eax`` in line 00401380, 
so we can also check the value of ``eax``:

    username:
    abcdefgh
    serial number:
    979899100

    Breakpoint 1, 0x0000000000401396 in main () at main.cpp:42
    42	main.cpp: No such file or directory.

    (gdb) p $eax
    $1 = 97669968

Interesting! So version 1 of the keygen is obviously not correct. While 97 and
99 are as expected (ASCII codes of 'a' and 'c'), the two other numbers 66 and 68
are exactly 32 lower than the codes for 'b' and 'd'. Substracting 32 from the 
ASCII codes of the lower case characters gives the upper case version. So 
the *crackme1* is probably converting the even character to
upper case.

Let's run the same experiment with an all uppercase username:

    username:
    ABCDEFGH
    serial number:
    979899100


    Breakpoint 1, 0x0000000000401396 in main () at main.cpp:42
    42	main.cpp: No such file or directory.

    (gdb) p $eax
    $1 = 97669968

From this we can see that the code is actually also converting the odd
characters to lower-case. This leads to version 2 of the keygen 
algorithm:

Version 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Convert every odd character of the username to lower case, and every 
even character to upper case. Then concatenate the ASCII codes of the 
letters and take the first 8 bytes of the result:

    def keygen_version2(username):
        for i, u in enumerate(username):
            if i%2:
                key += str(ord(u.upper()))
            else:
                key += str(ord(u.lower()))
        return key[:8]
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, let's test usernames that are longer than 8 characters to
see what happens:

    username: abcdefgh --> serial number: 97669968
    username: abcdefghi --> serial number: 66996810
    username: abcdefghij --> serial number: 99681017
    username: abcdefghijk --> serial number: 68101701
    username: abcdefghijkl -->  serial number: 10170103

So the serial number always has 8 digits, but those are no longer the
first 8 bytes of the concatenation for longer usernames. Doing some 
more testing we find that the algorithms takes:

bytes 0-7  for  8 character usernames
bytes 2-9  for  9 character usernames
bytes 4-11 for 10 character usernames
bytes 6-13 for 11 character usernames
bytes 8-15 for 12 character usernames

So the final keygen algorithm is:

Final Keygen
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    def generate_key(username):
        if not 8 <= len(username) <= 12:
            print("username must be between 8 and 12 characters.")
            quit()
        key = '' 
        for i, u in enumerate(username):
            if i%2:
                key += str(ord(u.upper()))
            else:
                key += str(ord(u.lower()))
        return int(key[2*(len(username)-8):][0:8])
----------------------------------------------------------------------
